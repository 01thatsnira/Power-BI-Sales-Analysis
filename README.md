# Power-BI-Sales-Analysis
Developed an interactive Power BI report with three analytical pages. The first page shows sales and profit by state using multiple visuals and a Top-N model to identify the top three states. The second page provides customer-level analysis with dynamic selection. The third page displays order-level, state-wise analysis using map visuals.
